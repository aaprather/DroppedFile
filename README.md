SUMMER 2018
DroppedFile.com (Currently offline)
Project created with mainly ASP.NET C#, and a very small amount of jQuery.
This project is not currently active due to school and internship, but I would like to eventually go back and use angularJS on parts of this project as well as refactor some of the code.
