# - DroppedFile -

Simple [ASP .NET Web Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) file sharing web-application.

This ASP .NET version of DroppedFile is no longer being developed but a ReactJS version may eventually be written.

## Development
This project was created *Summer*  2018 following the completion of my Senior Capstone project as a way to gain more practice with web-development.

This was a heavy .NET Web Forms project, with only the bare minimum amount of JavaScript used.

Files were hosted via FTP using [VSFTPD](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/vsftpd) which was being ran on my  local Linux box.

The database used was a Microsoft SQL Server being hosted by Amazon AWS.
